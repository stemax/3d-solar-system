## 🌌 Overview
This project is a **3D Solar System simulation** built with **Three.js**, featuring interactive camera controls, realistic planetary orbits, and dynamic visual effects. It provides an immersive exploration of our solar system with interactive planets, glowing Sun effects, and smooth camera navigation.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Interactive Camera**: Seamless orbit, zoom, and pan with mouse controls.
- **Realistic Orbits**: Planets revolve around the Sun at adjustable speeds and distances.
- **Planetary Rotation**: Each planet spins on its axis for a natural appearance.
- **Sun Glow & Protuberances**: Dynamic glow effects and protuberances for the Sun using custom shaders and particles.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive for various screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Realistic illumination to enhance visuals.
- **Custom Textures**: High-quality planetary and solar textures.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Three.js**: 3D rendering engine for creating and animating the solar system.
- **OrbitControls**: Smooth and interactive camera controls.
- **GLSL Shaders**: Custom shaders for Sun glow and effects.
- **Particle Systems**: Used to simulate solar protuberances.
- **Textures**: High-resolution images for planets and the Sun.
